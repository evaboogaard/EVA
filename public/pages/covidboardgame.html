        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This board game is developed by Eva Boogaard and Danique Lammertink,
          it's a political boardgame that takes place in the pandemic and the
          goal is to get fully vaccinated.
        </p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          I am very interested in politics - especially during the pandemic that
          was happening while me and Danique created this game. We wanted to
          create a game that was all about COVID in The Netherlands - with a
          healthy dose of humor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started creating a prototype that was a lot like monopoly, but
          realized that it wouldn't be very interesting to play. In the
          weeks that passed we worked on creating as many prototypes as possible
          and testing them to see if our game was fun to play.
        </p>
        <p>
          The virus-shaped board was something we held onto till the end. We
          also created a lot of questions and assignments for the players if
          they arrive on a certain spot on the board. For example: "give a press
          conference about the new rules as if you are the leader of the party
          you chose".
        </p>

        <h3>End Result</h3>
        <p>
          Before starting the game, the players all choose a political party.
          This will affect further capabilities while playing. There’s different
          squares with different consequences, but the main goal of the game is
          to get fully vaccinated.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created three physical copies of the game using cardboard, a UV
          printer, a 3D printer, thick paper and an ordinary printer.
