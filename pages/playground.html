            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As someone who loves CSS but doesn't have much experience yet, this course was perfect. Picking a
                character or an artwork and trying to recreate this solely by using CSS teaches you a lot about how to
                use the medium in a completely different way.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>Starting this project off, I didn't have that much experience in CSS yet. I started making a
                    breakdown sketch of the character I wanted to recreate: Baymax. All of his different body parts were
                    put into different divs and spans in my HTML document.</p>
                <p>After the HTML was tailored to (almost) perfection, I started styling the different parts. I used a
                    lot of different shadows, border-radiuses and z-index values to create the character. This challenge
                    has taught me that CSS has an endless amount of possibilities, most of which I don't even know half
                    of.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>End Result</h3>
            <p>I created Baymax and a custom gradient-heavy background using CSS only. I added in some animations to
                make him, the sun, moon and stars move. Using JS there is also a night mode possible. </p>
